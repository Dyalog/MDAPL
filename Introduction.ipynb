    "\n",
    " - How pedantic should I be with small table-like sections that are formatted with alignments in the original text? E.g. [right in the beginning of the \"Let's Write Our First Programs\" section](#Let's-Write-Our-First-Programs) I split the table-like section in a small enumeration with the code inputs or after that, the explanation of the dfn I wrote as a simple enumeration;\n",
    "\n",
    " - Sort of a meta question, but how much freedom do I have to rewrite little portions of the text? Cf.\n",
    "   - the questions below;\n",
    "   - [the first paragraph of the \"Simple Operations\" sub sub-section](#Simple-Operations), which I changed a bit because the book is now being written in a Jupyter notebook;\n",
    "   - the table just before the section on [reduction](#Reduction-Unifies-Traditional-Notations);\n",
    "\n",
    " - Should we go with \"double click\" or \"double-click\"? This chapter uses both;\n",
    "\n",
    " - Can I use lowercase after a colon? I.e. instead of \"_\\[...\\] about them here: We won't \\[...\\]_ \" have \"_\\[...\\] about them here: we won't \\[...\\]_ \".\n",
    " \n",
    " - Should chapter titles be Camel Cased or should they be written in standard English? First letter is upper case and the remainder is lower cased by default?\n",
    " \n",
    " - Can I use MathJax around numbers embedded in the text? Or should I transcribe them to English? Or should I leave them as-is? E.g. [last sentence of the first paragraph here](#Array-Processing).\n",
    " \n",
    " - Can I replace the PASCAL example code with Python code [at the end of the \"Array Processing\" section](#Array-Processing)? PASCAL is _so_ old...\n",
    "   - on a related note, in the [Indexing](#Indexing) section the author says many languages use () for indexing instead of []; I'd like to update the sentence to say using [] is like many other programming languages.\n",
    " \n",
    " - For aligned text should I use LaTeX tables or Markdown arrays/alignat environments? Cf. [this example](#Most-Symbols-Have-a-Double-Meaning).\n",

    "# Introduction - Will You Play APL With Me?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Will You Follow Us?\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to have you discover a new land, a land where people who may or may not be specialists in programming can process their data, build computerised applications, and take pleasure in using a programming language which is an extremely elegant and powerful tool of thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beware: Dyalog APL is Addictive!\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the hundreds of programming languages which have been created, most of them share the same fundamentals, the same basic unstruction set, approximately the same functions, and by and large the same methods to control the logic of a program. This greatly influences the way people imagine and build solutions to computing problems. Because the languages are so similar, the solutions are similar. Does it mean that these are the only ways of solving problems? Of course not!\n",
    "\n",
    "Dyalog APL is there to open doors, windows, and minds, prove that original new methods do exist, and that matehmatics is not limited to four basic operations. Using APL will expand and extend the range of mental models that you use to solve problems, but beware:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are hooked on APL, there is a real risk that you will no longer accept the limitations of \"traditional\" programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation and Keyboard\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have access to a computer with Dyalog APL installed, you should still be able to gain an appreciation of the language from these pages and, we hope, enjoy the experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed Dyalog, not only can you read this book, but you can also experiment on your own computer using the examples below, and invent your own data and calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a copy of Dyalog APL, install it as explained in the User Guide. Just run the installation program and accept all the defaults; there is no need to change anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might like to refer to section A-1 for additional installation hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see in the following pages, APL uses special symbols, like `⍉`, `⍴` and `↓`, which you enter using a special keyboard layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will not need all of the special symbols to read the following pages. The picture below illustrates a cut-down version of the UK keyboard layout, with only the APL symbols that are referred to in this introduction. They are shown on a grey background. The US keyboard is slightly different, but the symbols we need are positioned identically. The full keyboard layout is shown in the User Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "![UK keyboard layout](res/Fig_A4_Kbd_UK.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the keyboard is to be used:\n",
    "\n",
    " - All the standard English letters, numerals and symbols are typed as usual.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The majority of the APL symbols are obtained by pressing the \"*Ctrl*\" key, in conjunction with another key. For example, to obtain `⍴`, you must press *Ctrl* and R. From now on, this keystroke will be identified as \"*Ctrl* + R\". On the keyboard layout illustrated above, the symbols that you enter this way are printed at the bottom-right corner of each key.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Most other APL symbols are obtained by simultaneously pressing \"*Ctrl*\" and \"*Shift*\" and then the appropriate key. For example, to obtain `⍉`, you must press *Ctrl* and *Shift* and 6. From now on, this keystroke will be identified as \"*Ctrl*+*Shift*+6\". On the keyboard layout illustrated above, the symbols that you enter this way are printed at the top-right corner of each key.\n",
    " \n",
    " - A few APL symbols are obtained by pressing the \"*Alt Gr*\" key (or *Ctrl*+*Alt* if your keyboard does not have an \"*Alt Gr*\" key), simultaneously with another key, but you don't have to bother about them here: we won't be using them in the examples in this introduction.\n",
    " \n",
    " - In case you initially have any difficulty with the keyboard, there is a \"language bar\" on top of the sessio nscree, with all the APL symbols on it. When you need a symbol, you just have to click on it and the symbol will appear wherever your cursor is positioned.\n",
    " \n",
    "You may notice that some symbols appear twice on the keyboard. This is the case for the symbols < = >. These symbols are all part of a normal keyboard (the black ones), but they have been repeated on the APL keyboard, mostly in order to group the symbols used for _comparison functions_ together (the red ones). Do not worry: no matter which key you use to produce one of the duplicated symbols, you'll obtain the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilities and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the examples, you can just type what you read in the following pages, but sometimes you will need some data which we have prepared for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is contained in a special file (called a workspace) named `DyalogTutor_EN.dws` which accompanies this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have the file, please refer to section A-1 for instructions on how to download it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file can only be opened by Dyalog APL. You can open it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - In Windows Explorer, double-click on the file's name. APL will be started, and it will then open the file.\n",
    " - Or, start APL by double clicking on the Dyalog APL icon. The, using the \"`File/Open`\" menu, search for the file and open it.\n",
    " - Alternatively, you can use an APL command to load it into the session, like shown below:"

Very often it says that for example multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction, meaning that an expression like $5 \\times 3 + 2$ gives $17$, because the multiplication is done first, and then the addition.\n",

For example, which precedence should we give to `⍳` or `↓` or `⌈`, for which we do not have an established tradition? And what about the functions we write ourselves?\n",
    "\n",
    "The democratic solution adopted in APL is \"*We hold these truths to be self-evident that all functions are created equal!*\". The only and very simple rule is that any function works on the result of the entire expression to its right, and, if it is a dyadic function, the value immediately to the left of it. As usual, parentheses can be used to group parts of an expression.\n",

    "`×` works on `5` (the value immediately to the left of it) and the result of `3 + 2`, the entire expression to the right of it. Even though it is not strictly correct, many people say that APL evaluates from right to left. In any case, the result of the expression is `25` in APL!\n",
    "\n",
    "Had we written `(5 × 3) + 2` instead the result would of course have been `17`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may take a little while to get used to this slightly unfamiliar rule, but once it has been learned it is really a great advantage because you can direct your energy towards solving your problem and not have to remember complex rules just to satisfy the computer's need for guidance.\n",

    "### Use Many Other Calculating Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We have discovered some original functions, which are completely absent from most other programming languages, like `⍴`, `↑`, `⍉`, `∊` and *Outer Product*. Those features lead to new methods and new algorithms to process data; this is one of the main advantages of APL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only do you have a lot more functions: *Inner Product* (generalized matrix product), many built-in mathematical tools (trigonometry, matrix inverse, conversions to and from any numerical base, etc.), but you can also handle generalized (nested) arrays; arrays which contain arrays, which themselves contain arrays, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the possible solutions to a single problem is often so wide that is is probably the reason why people never get tired of using APL: They always have something new to discover and to invent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create User-friendly Applications with the GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all modern programming languages, Dyalog APL has a Graphic User Interface (GUI) under Microsoft Windows and Win32 emulators under Unix. It allows you to design pleasant user interfaces with all the items and features you are familiar with. Even a beginner can quickly create an interface and process the data with all the power of the language, whereas in traditional languages, the same operation would need days or weeks of programming. The Microsoft.NET interface supports the use of WinForms and Windows Presentation Foundation GUI elements as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Dyalog APL has built-in instructions to access data files, and SQL databases like Oracle, SQL Server, or other popular databases. These itnerfaces allow you to visualise and process part or all of a data base as if it were an array, to which you can apply all the array processing functions available in APL. That saves you a lot of heavy programming tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dyalog APL has also its own powerful fiel system. These files are collections of arrays of any shapes or sizes, which can be processed with the full power of the language. Databases built with this special feature are extremely compact ($2$ to $3$ times smaller than an equivalent relational database). They can be shared, and they offer much greater flexibility and superior performance compared to traditional database management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build an Efficient Partnership With Microsoft Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Excel, probably the most popular spreadsheet manager, is used all over the world by millions of people. It appears that Excel is an easy way to enter data into a computer in a tabular form, and it is also an excellent product to produce everyday business reports and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Excel is convenient for small business applications, it is too limited to process complex calculations, or when some operations involve data located in many workbooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel and APL can easily be combined in an efficient partnership. Excel is used to input data in a very flexible way into spreadsheets, which most users are familiar with. APL can then read dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of sheets, aggregate the data, and perform very complex calculations, which may be controlled and parameterized through the GUI interface. Of course, the results can be printed, but they can aso be output to the users in the for of specially prepared Excel worksheets. In these worksheets, the users can proceed to additional operations for their particular needs, or produce graphs of their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### And Also...\n",
    "\n",
    "You can interface APL with the Internet, write your own web server, use multithreading to process simultaneous tasks, use all the advantages of true *Object Oriented Programming*, and use many attractive features, which are beyond the scope of this quick survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you have found this language rather engaging, but before you decide to invest time and energy in developing APL applications, you would like to be sure of your choice. Let's give you some answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is Dyalog APL A Professional Tool?\n",
    "\n",
    "Among many others, here are some significant examples of important applications:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Long term Board level financial planning for one of the world's five biggest petroleum companies, used over $12$ years.\n",
    " - The management of supplies required from 'today + 2 days' to 'today + 3 months', by the assembly lines of the $6$ principal factories of a major international car manufacturer.\n",
    " - Risk Management for an important insurance group.\n",
    " \n",
    "These three examples have common characteristics, positioning them as major industrial applications:\n",
    "\n",
    " - They are particularly crucial because considerable finances are at stake.\n",
    " - They must be absolutely reliable. A major car manufacturer works must not be brought to a stop by a programming bug.\n",
    " - The first two applications operate in a highly volatile business environment. As their requirements are always changing, the programs undergo constant mutation. These evolutions must be made with very short development cycles.\n",
    " \n",
    "So we can answer: Yes, for a reasonable cost in labour, APL makes it possible to create, maintain, support and further develop large, sensitive applications of the highest level of quality, reliability, and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can Dyalog APL Fit a Professional Developer's Needs?\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristics of APL make it easy to use, lead to quick development, and help to produce light and flexible code. Programs developed in APL can evolve quickly, to fit changing user requirements at will.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Because APL uses symbols rather than words to represent operations, a programmer can use any word for his own data and programs names; they will never be in conflict with the language structure and contents.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Due to its array-processing capability, APL dramatically reduces the needs for programming loops. Because all such intricacies are removed, the code is much lighter, and the programmer can concentrate all his attention and skill on the true core of computing requirements.\n",
    " \n",
    " - In many programming languages, a programmer would have to declare that each variable will be an array of such and such dimensions, containing values with a specific data type. There is nothing similar in APL. The size and the data type of a variable arise from the way in which the variable has been produced. If one extracts two rows and five columns from a matrix, the result will of course be a $2$ by $5$ matrix. And if we divide $486$ into $7$, the result will of course be a fractional value; there is no need to specify it in advance.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The extensive set of direct operations on data offered by APL leads to new approaches. For traditional problems, which have been solved in the same way in most programming languages for years, APL suddenly offers new solutions, which appear to be light, straighforward, very general, and easy to maintain because they are easy to read.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The readability of APL often surprises people who practise other programming languages; they probably forget that the languages they use are totally obscure for most non specialists. APL is learned and used efficiently by people who are not data processing professionals, but are instead specialists in their professional fields, such as accountancy, chemistry, insurance, logistics, finance and biology. They have less difficulty with APL than with the problems they have to solve, and most often, they solve them with APL. They could not achieve this alone with any other programming languages, but would require the help of programming specialists... who of course know nothing of the problem domain in question.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Where is APL Typically Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "APL is typically used in situations where there is a lot to be gained if people who understand a problem can be closely involved in developing solutions. Sometimes application code is written in the afternoon by the same people who read the latest research reports or legislation in the morning - or by members of a very small team who have overlapping skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more traditional approach, in which the specialist teams would need the help of professional programmers, such teams may find that valuable information was lost in the \"process\", so that several iterations would be required in order to reach a satisfactory solution. Especailly when a problem has a mathematical or technical foundation, APL can turbo-charge the development cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if there is no immediate urgency, APL allows the path between \"users and coders\" to be much shorter than is the case when \"traditional\" technologies, in which *requirement gathering*, *specification*, *architecture* and *coding* are often handled by separate teams. If you have a novel idea that you would like to investiage (or \"get to market\") quickly, you may reach your goal very much more easily by learning APL or employing a small team of APL developers (who will be able to \"speak your language\"), rather than becoming or using \"programmers\" to develop solutions for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "APL is most widely used in the financial industry, which has a mathematical foundation, and rapidly changing requirements: In this environment, the use of APL can provide a significant competitive advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately some problems cannot wait!\n",
    "\n",
    "Great flexibility and speed is the true commercial foundation for APL. With APL one can develop in direct contact with the users and involve them from the outset in the continual modification of the object of the development. Afterwards, as an application continues to evolve, it is still the speed of development which makes APL a tool especially well adapted to changing environments.\n",
