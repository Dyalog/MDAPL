    "When you use APL, you type an expression or a command into the session window, and the result of the expression (or a message resulting from the execution of the command) is displayed on the next line(s). So an APL \"session\" is a sequence of user input lines (expressions and/or commands) interleaved with the results of the expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you type these expressions and/or commands in the Dyalog APL software you installed, or on the [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org), you will see that APL initially positions the input cursor 6 spaces in from the left margin. Unless you deliberately move the cursor before you start typing, the expressions you enter into the system will therefore be indented; you can evaluate what you type by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, which will make the result appear below what you typed and left aligned with the margin. This interactive session is commonly referred to as an ***interpreter session*** because some software is interpreting what you type and providing you with results on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book, however, was written in Jupyter notebooks, which works in a slightly different way. In here, you can find blocks of text (like the one you are reading *right now*) interleaved with code blocks. Depending on where you are reading this, these code blocks may be static or they may be interactive, allowing you, the reader, to change them and run them at will. The expressions you enter go in the shaded rectangles (the ***input cells***, preceded by a `In [X]:`) and you can evaluate them by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. The results of the expressions are then placed inside white rectangles (the ***output cells***, preceded by the corresponding `Out[X]:`) which get updated when you re-evaluate the same *input cell*.\n",

    "It is recommended that you go through this tutorial in front of your computer, and experiment by typing the expressions given below into the Dyalog APL interpreter session. Alternatively, if you are reading the book online in a dynamic format, you are encouraged to re-run the *input cells* for yourself.

Each function is ideally small, self-contained, and performs a single specific task.</small>\n",

    "\n",
    "You can close an APL session using three traditional Windows methods, and two APL system commands:\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can click on the \"Close\" cross at the top-right corner of your APL window.\n",
    " - You can press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd>.\n",
    " - You can activate the menu \"File\" > \"Exit\".\n",
    " - You can issue the system command `)off`.\n",
    " - You can issue the system command `)continue`.\n",
    " \n",
    "The first two methods will ask if you want to save your current session configuration, a so called *Continue WS* (this will be seen in Chapter L), and the log of everything that you did during the session. The next two methods will close APL without any question or warning, and will not save your configuration. The last one will save a *Continue WS* before exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, always **remember to save your work** (if necessary) before you quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contents of a WS\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a workspace contains functions (programs) and variables which interact to constitute some useful application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large memories of modern computers support very big workspaces, and a single WS is generally enough to store even a very complex application, or several applications. However, it is good practice to store different applications in different workspaces: accounting, budget, customer care, etc... It is not recommended that you mix several applications in a single WS.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if appropriate, it is possible for a function to dynamically load another workspace (without any intervention by the user), and activate a different or complementary application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, a unique WS should be sufficient to contain all your experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "If several workspaces need to share a command set of utility programs, this can be accomplished by dynamically importing the utilities from a common source. This will be seen in Chapter L.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our First System Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to recapitulate, here is a little summary of the system commands we've just discovered. Many other commands will be studied in Chapter L. The following conventions are used in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The command names are writing using normal characters; the parameters are in *italics*;\n",
    " - Parameters withing {braces} are optional;\n",
    " - _names_ represents a list of variable or function names;\n",
    " - _wsname_ is the name of a WS.\n",
    "   - This name may contain a file extension, which is only necessary if it is different from \"dws\".\n",
    "   - This name may also be preceded by an optional path. If the path is not specified, APL searches in all the directories referenced in \"Options\" > \"Configure...\" > \"Workspace\" > \"Workspace search path*.\n",
    " \n",
    "| Command | Usage |\n",
    "| :- | :- |\n",
    "| )vars | Lists the variables in the active workspace. |\n",
    "| )fns | Lists the user defined functions in the active workspace. |\n",
    "| )erase *names* | Deletes the named objects from the active workspace. |\n",
    "| )clear | Deletes everything and leaves the active workspace empty. |\n",
    "| )save | Saves the active workspace under its current name, or: opens the File Save dialog box if the WS has no name yet. |\n",
    "| )save *wsname* | Saves the active WS under the given path/name/extension. |\n",
    "| )lib | Gives the list of all workspaces in the *workspace search path*. |\n",
    "| )lib *path* | Gives the list of all workspaces in the specified path. |\n",
    "| )drop *wsname* | Deletes a saved WS from disk. |\n",
    "| )load | Opens the File Open dialog box, from which a workspace can be selected. It will replace the active WS. |\n",
    "| )load *wsname* | Replaces the contents of the active WS with the referenced WS. |\n",
    "| )copy *wsname* *names* | Imports the named items from the specified WS into the active WS, where they may overwrite objects identically named. |\n",
    "| )copy *wsname* | Imports all contents of the specified WS. |\n",
    "| )pcopy *wsname* {*names*} | Similar to `)copy`, but does not overwrite existing objects. |\n",
    "| )wsid | Displays the name of the current (active) WS. |\n",
    "| )off | Closes the APL session. |\n",
