    "### Some Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapters we made a distinction between the functions and operators which are part of APL, like `+`, `×`, `⌈` and `/` (we refer to them as *primitives*), and those functions and operators that are created by the user which are represented, not by a symbol, but by a name like `Average` (we say they are *user-defined*).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also made an important distinction between *functions*, which apply to data and which return data, and *operators*, which apply to functions or data and produce *derived* functions (see [the definition of Reduce](./Some-Primitive-Functions.ipynb#Definition)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can distinguish between 4 major categories of processing tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Name | Examples | Refer to |\n",

    "\n",
    "This chapter is devoted to user-defined *functions*. The subject of user-defined *operators* will be covered later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further categorise user-defined functions according to the way they process data. Firstly we can distinguish between ***Direct*** and ***Procedural*** **functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    " - ***Direct*** functions (commonly referred to as ***dfns***) are defined in a very formal manner.\n",
    "   - They are usually designed for pure calculation, without any external or user interfaces. *Dfns* do not allow loops except by recursion and have limited options for conditional programming.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - ***Procedural*** functions (commonly referred to as ***tradfns***, short for *traditional functions*) are less formal and look much more like programs written in other languages.\n",
    "   - They provide greater flexibility for building major applications which involve user interfaces, access to files or databases and other external interfaces. *Tradfns* may take no arguments and behave like scripts.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Even though you may write entire systems with dfns, you might prefer to restrict their use to encapsulate statements that, together, perform some meaningful operation on the data given.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second distinction we can make concerns the number of arguments a user-defined function can have.\n",
    "\n",
    " - ***Dyadic*** functions take two arguments which are placed on either side of the function (`X f Y`);\n",
    " - ***Monadic*** functions take a single argument which is placed to the right of the function (`f Y`);\n",
    " - ***Niladic*** functions take no argument at all;\n",
    " - ***Ambivalent*** functions are dyadic functions whose left argument is optional."

    "\n",
    "Dyalog APL has a highly configurable development and debugging environment, designed to fit the requirements of very different kinds of programmers. This environment is controlled by configuration parameters; let us determine which context will suit you best.\n",

    "\n",
    "This configuration provides a single Edit window and a single Trace window, each of which is \"docked\" along one of the Session window borders. You can dock these windows along any of the Session window sides. For example, <!--figure-->the figure below<!--IDE_Window_Horizontal_Layout--> shows a configuration with three horizontal panes, highly suitable for entering and editing very long statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Edit and Trace windows in a horizontal layout](res/IDE_Window_Horizontal_Layout.png)\n",

    "The Edit window supports the *Multiple Document Interface* (MDI). This means that you can work on more than one function at a time.\n",

    " - On the Windows interpreter you can use the \"Window\" menu to *Tile* and *Cascade*, or you can maximise any one of the functions to concentrate solely upon it.\n",
    " - If you are using RIDE the default behaviour is to open a tab per item you are editing.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you are working on a relatively small screen you may find that you prefer to work with \"floating\" windows in a layout similar to the one in <!--figure-->here<!--IDE_Floating_Window_Layout-->:\n",

To change this behaviour and allow for multi-line dfns, you can go to \"Options\" &#8680; \"Configure...\" &#8680; \"Session\" and check the experimental multi-line input box at the bottom.\n",

Hence, to fix a function means assigning it to a name and making it available for use in the session window.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from extremely simple calculations, most programs rely on certain statements being executed only if a given condition is satisfied (conditional execution) or on a set of statements being executed again and again, until a given limit is reached (looping). The APL language offers a special set of syntactic elements to control the flow of statements inside tradfns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the very first versions of APL, the only way to implement conditional execution and looping was to use the symbol `→` (the *branch arrow*, typed with <kbd>APL</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd>). This was used to jump from one statement to another, skipping over other statements (conditional execution) or jumping back to repeat a set of statements again (looping). The branch arrow is equivalent to the GOTO statement in other languages. Contemporary versions of APL include a special set of keywords which offer a much more flexible, easy to use and easy to read way to control the flow of execution. They are also very similar to those used in most other languages. These are known as ***Control structures***.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall begin by using control structures and then introduce you later to the old way of programming, only because you may come across it in some existing programs, and because it sometimes offers shorter or more convenient ways of doing things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control structures are blocks of statements which begin and end with special keywords. These keywords are all **prefixed** with a ***colon***, like `:If` or `:Repeat`. This prevents the names of your variables to clash with these keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keywords can be typed in lower or upper case, but Dyalog APL will always store and display them using a fixed spelling convention commonly known as CamelCase or, more specifically, PascalCase. Following this convention, a keyword has an upper case first letter and the following letters in lower case. Composite keywords like \"`EndIf`\" and \"`GoTo`\" capitalise the first letter of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening keywords are used to begin the conditional execution or repeated execution of a block of statements. Usually (but not always), the block is ended by a corresponding keyword that starts with `:End`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sets of opening/closing keywords are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Opening | Closing |\n",
    "| :- | :- |\n",
    "| `:If` | `:EndIf` |\n",
    "| `:For` | `:EndFor` |\n",
    "| `:Select` | `:EndSelect` |\n",
    "| `:Repeat` | `:Until` |\n",
    "| | `:EndRepeat` |\n",
    "| `:While` | `:EndWhile` |\n",
    "| | `:Until` |\n",
    "| `:Trap` | `:EndTrap` |\n",
    "| `:With` | `:EndWith` |\n",
    "| `:Hold` | `:EndHold` |\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary keywords shown above can be complemented by additional keywords which qualify more precisely what is to be done:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `:Else`\n",
    " - `:ElseIf`\n",

    " - `:Case`\n",
    " - `:CaseList`\n",
    " - `:Until`\n",
    " \n",
    "And finally, some keywords may be used to conditionally alter the flow of execution within a control structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following keywords will not be studied in this chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `:Trap... :EndTrap` concerns event processing and will be seen in [the chapter \"Event Handling\"](./Event-Handling.ipynb);\n",

    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we use \"`:Select`\", with additional \"`:Case`\" or \"`:CaseList`\" clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence begins with `:Select` followed by the *control expression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then followed by any number of blocks, each of which will be executed if the *control value* is equal to one of the values specified in the corresponding clause:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `:Case` for a single value.\n",
    " - `:CaseList` for a list of possible values.\n",
    " \n",
    "The sequence ends with `:EndSelect`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have as many `:Case` or `:CaseList` clauses as you need and in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the control value is not equal to any of the specified values, nothing is executed, unless there is one final `:Else` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with `:If... :ElseIf... :Else`, the blocks are mutually exclusive. The `:Case` statements are examined from the top and once a match is found and the corresponding block of statements has been executed, execution will continue with the first line after the `:EndSelect` statement - even if the *control value* matches other `:Case` or `:CaseList` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In <!--figure-->the diagram below<!--Control_Flow_Select-->, the *control expression* is simply `District` and the *control value* is whatever value the variable holds. Then, Block **1** is executed if `District` is equal to 50, Block **2** is executed if `District` is equal to 19 and Block **3** is executed if `District` is equal to 41, 42 or 53, but not if `District` is equal to 50. In that case, Block **1** will already have been executed and the execution won't reach this `:CaseList`. Therefore, we conclude that including 50 in this `:CaseList` is superfluous and we better remove it to avoid any confusion. Finally, Block **4** is only executed if `District` is not equal to any of the values listed above.\n",

    "We can use a similar logic as that of the first exercise, except now we want to start the indices at `⍺+1` and go up until `≢⍵`. For this to happen, we first need to find out how many numbers we need. If a vector has `≢⍵` elements and we are going to drop `⍺` of them, we are going to be left with `(≢⍵)-⍺`. This means `⍳(≢⍵)-⍺` will generate the correct amount of indices, but they will be starting at `1` and should start at `⍺+1`, so we just need to add `⍺` to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we just need to worry about what happens if `⍺` is too large, i.e. if we want to ignore too many elements. The reverse of that concern is, what happens if `(≢⍵)-⍺` is too small? Recall that `(≢⍵)-⍺` tells you how many elements you will want to keep. But that number must be at least `0` elements (i.e. \"keep no elements\") because it makes no sense to keep a negative number of elements. So we can just use `⌈` to find the maximum between `0` and `(≢⍵)-⍺`. If `⍺` is too large, `0⌈(≢⍵)-⍺` gives `0` and `⍳0` is the empty vector `⍬`, so the indexing will work just fine."
