    " - in the same section, should I change the functions to ask for user input / give error messages as standard IO instead of using the fancy GUI things? Those work poorly with the Jupyter notebook and I'm afraid they may not work on other platforms.\n",
    " - write about tail recursion in specialist's section;\n",
    " - This chapter uses some helper files that should be linked to from this chapter. I can't find them online, where are they? Should I upload them to somewhere else and link to that place? Should I upload them to GH, for example?\n",
    " - the book says \"The SQL interface is not described in this tutorial; please refer instead to the specialised brochures.\". What brochures? Where are they?\n",
    " - **PRINTING STUFF ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS, PROBABLY... BUT REPLACE IT WITH BUILDING A PDF AND PRINTING IT LATER.** does the stuff on \"Printing Results on a Printer\" work on mac/Linux? And is this section relevant, at all..? also this section talks about newleaf and rainpro, formerly in chapter S. Are newleaf and rainpro still relevant and will they be kept in this new version of the book?\n",
    " - **CHECK THE `CALC` WS** on the section about using GUIs for I/O it has a screenshot. Can I get a screenshot of a GUI of a more modern APL program?\n",
    " - **KEEP THEM AS IS; WHEN IT MAKES SENSE, ASK TO DO THE EXERCISE WITH A DFN AS WELL** there's many exercises targeting tradfns and older control structures. Should I leave those as-is? Adapt them? Replace them with exercises more suitable for dfns? Truth be told, with the little primitives the user knows and no operators at all, it isn't very easy to write many useful functions."

    "\n",
    "In previous chapters we made a distinction between the functions and operators which are part of APL, like `+`, `×`, `⌈` and `/` (we refer to them as *primitives*), and those functions and operators that are created by the user which are represented, not by a symbol, but by a name like `Average` (we say they are *user-defined*).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also made an important distinction between *functions*, which apply to data and which return data, and *operators*, which apply to functions or data and produce *derived* functions (see [the definition of Reduce](./Some-Primitive-Functions.ipynb#Definition)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can distinguish between 4 major categories of processing tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Name | Examples | Refer to |\n",
    "| :- | :- | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| Built-in tools | Primitive functions | `+` `×` `⌈` `⍴` | Previous chapters |\n",
    "| | Primitive operators | `/` | [Chapter on Operators](./Operators.ipynb) |\n",
    "| User-defined tools | **User-defined functions** | `Average` | This chapter |\n",
    "| | User-defined operators | | [Section on User-Defined Operators](./Operators.ipynb#User-Defined-Operators) |\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is devoted to user-defined *functions*. The subject of user-defined *operators* will be covered later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further categorise user-defined functions according to the way they process data. Firstly we can distinguish between ***Direct*** and ***Procedural*** **functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    " - ***Direct*** functions (commonly referred to as ***dfns***) are defined in a very formal manner.\n",
    "   - They are usually designed for pure calculation, without any external or user interfaces. *Dfns* do not allow loops except by recursion and have limited options for conditional programming.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - ***Procedural*** functions (commonly referred to as ***tradfns***, short for *traditional functions*) are less formal and look much more like programs written in other languages.\n",
    "   - They provide greater flexibility for building major applications which involve user interfaces, access to files or databases and other external interfaces. *Tradfns* may take no arguments and behave like scripts.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Even though you may write entire systems with dfns, you might prefer to restrict their use to encapsulate statements that, together, perform some meaningful operation on the data given.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second distinction we can make concerns the number of arguments a user-defined function can have.\n",
    "\n",
    " - ***Dyadic*** functions take two arguments which are placed on either side of the function (`X f Y`);\n",
    " - ***Monadic*** functions take a single argument which is placed to the right of the function (`f Y`);\n",
    " - ***Niladic*** functions take no argument at all;\n",
    " - ***Ambivalent*** functions are dyadic functions whose left argument is optional."

    "\n",
    "This configuration provides a single Edit window and a single Trace window, each of which is \"docked\" along one of the Session window borders. You can dock these windows along any of the Session window sides.

    "\n",
    "![The Edit and Trace windows in a horizontal layout](res/IDE_Window_Horizontal_Layout.png)\n",

To change this behaviour and allow for multi-line dfns, you can go to \"Options\" &#8680; \"Configure...\" &#8680; \"Session\" and check the experimental multi-line input box at the bottom.\n",

Hence, to fix a function means assigning it to a name and making it available for use in the session window.\n",

Even so, lexical scoping will prove to be helpful later down the road: imagine a large(r) function inside which we define a small utility dfn to use with an operator, but we want the dfn to make use of things we have already computed inside the outer function. Lexical scoping kicks in at that point, allowing the inner dfn to access everything the outer function already computed.\n",

If you are used to programming in other programming languages that follow paradigms other than the array-oriented one, dfns may look very limited in their lack of conventional control structures and looping structures. As it turns out, in writing good array-oriented programs you can usually do away without these. What is more, the power of many of the built-in operators you will learn about in [a future chapter](./Operators.ipynb) will cover that gap in a very suitable way."

    "## Flow Control in Tradfns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from extremely simple calculations, most programs rely on certain statements being executed only if a given condition is satisfied (conditional execution) or on a set of statements being executed again and again, until a given limit is reached (looping). The APL language offers a special set of syntactic elements to control the flow of statements inside tradfns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the very first versions of APL, the only way to implement conditional execution and looping was to use the symbol `→` (the *branch arrow*, typed with <kbd>APL</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd>). This was used to jump from one statement to another, skipping over other statements (conditional execution) or jumping back to repeat a set of statements again (looping). The branch arrow is equivalent to the GOTO statement in other languages. Contemporary versions of APL include a special set of keywords which offer a much more flexible, easy to use and easy to read way to control the flow of execution. They are also very similar to those used in most other languages. These are known as ***Control structures***.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall begin by using control structures and then introduce you later to the old way of programming, only because you may come across it in some existing programs, and because it sometimes offers shorter or more convenient ways of doing things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control structures are blocks of statements which begin and end with special keywords. These keywords are all **prefixed** with a ***colon***, like `:If` or `:Repeat`. This prevents the names of your variables to clash with these keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keywords can be typed in lower or upper case, but Dyalog APL will always store and display them using a fixed spelling convention commonly known as CamelCase or, more specifically, PascalCase. Following this convention, a keyword has an upper case first letter and the following letters in lower case. Composite keywords like \"`EndIf`\" and \"`GoTo`\" capitalise the first letter of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening keywords are used to begin the conditional execution or repeated execution of a block of statements. Usually (but not always), the block is ended by a corresponding keyword that starts with `:End`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sets of opening/closing keywords are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Opening | Closing |\n",
    "| :- | :- |\n",
    "| `:If` | `:EndIf` |\n",
    "| `:For` | `:EndFor` |\n",
    "| `:Select` | `:EndSelect` |\n",
    "| `:Repeat` | `:Until` |\n",
    "| | `:EndRepeat` |\n",
    "| `:While` | `:EndWhile` |\n",
    "| | `:Until` |\n",
    "| `:Trap` | `:EndTrap` |\n",
    "| `:With` | `:EndWith` |\n",
    "| `:Hold` | `:EndHold` |\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary keywords shown above can be complemented by additional keywords which qualify more precisely what is to be done:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `:Else`\n",
    " - `:ElseIf`\n",
    " - `:AndIf`\n",
    " - `:OrIf`\n",
    " - `:Case`\n",
    " - `:CaseList`\n",
    " - `:Until`\n",
    " \n",
    "And finally, some keywords may be used to conditionally alter the flow of execution within a control structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following keywords will not be studied in this chapter:\n",

    "To achieve this, we use \"`:Select`\", with additional \"`:Case`\" or \"`:CaseList`\" clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence begins with `:Select` followed by the *control expression*.\n",

    "It is then followed by any number of blocks, each of which will be executed if the *control value* is equal to one of the values specified in the corresponding clause:\n",

    " - `:Case` for a single value.\n",
    " - `:CaseList` for a list of possible values.\n",
    " \n",
    "The sequence ends with `:EndSelect`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have as many `:Case` or `:CaseList` clauses as you need and in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the control value is not equal to any of the specified values, nothing is executed, unless there is one final `:Else` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with `:If... :ElseIf... :Else`, the blocks are mutually exclusive. The `:Case` statements are examined from the top and once a match is found and the corresponding block of statements has been executed, execution will continue with the first line after the `:EndSelect` statement - even if the *control value* matches other `:Case` or `:CaseList` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In <!--figure-->the diagram below<!--Control_Flow_Select-->, the *control expression* is simply `District` and the *control value* is whatever value the variable holds. Then, Block **1** is executed if `District` is equal to 50, Block **2** is executed if `District` is equal to 19 and Block **3** is executed if `District` is equal to 41, 42 or 53, but not if `District` is equal to 50. In that case, Block **1** will already have been executed and the execution won't reach this `:CaseList`. Therefore, we conclude that including 50 in this `:CaseList` is superfluous and we better remove it to avoid any confusion. Finally, Block **4** is only executed if `District` is not equal to any of the values listed above.\n",

I have a dream today!│I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every│hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places shall be│made plain, and the crooked places shall be made straight and the│glory of the Lord will be revealed and all flesh shall seet it│together.│This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South│with.│With this faith, we will be able to hear out of the mountain of│despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to│transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful│symphony of brotherhood.│With this faith, we will be able to work together, knowing that│we will be free one day. This will be the day when all of God's│children will be able to sing with new meaning - \"My country │'this of thee; sweet land of liberty; of thee I sing; land where│my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride; from every mountain│side, let freedom ring\" - and if America is to be a great nation,│this must become true.│So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.│Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.│Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.│Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.│Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.│But not only that.│Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.│Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennesse.│Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi, from│every mountainside, let freedom ring.│And when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every│village and hamlet, from every state and city, we will be able│to speed up that day when all of God's children - black men and│white men, Jews and Gentiles, Catholics and Protestants - will be│able to join hands and to sing the words of the old Negro Spiritual;│\"Free at last, free at last; thank God Almighty, we are free at last\".  │-- Martin Luther King Jr. -- │Washington,August 28th 1963.││\n",

Code is then copied dynamically into the main workspace when required, using techniques that will be explained later.\n",

For this to happen, we first need to find out how many numbers we need. If a vector has `≢⍵` elements and we are going to drop `⍺` of them, we are going to be left with `(≢⍵)-⍺`. This means `⍳(≢⍵)-⍺` will generate the correct amount of indices, but they will be starting at `1` and should start at `⍺+1`, so we just need to add `⍺` to that.\n",

Recall that `(≢⍵)-⍺` tells you how many elements you will want to keep. But that number must be at least `0` elements (i.e. \"keep no elements\") because it makes no sense to keep a negative number of elements. So we can just use `⌈` to find the maximum between `0` and `(≢⍵)-⍺`. If `⍺` is too large, `0⌈(≢⍵)-⍺` gives `0` and `⍳0` is the empty vector `⍬`, so the indexing will work just fine."
