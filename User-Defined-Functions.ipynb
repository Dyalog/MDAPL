    "\n",
    "## Landmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapters we made a distinction between the functions and operators which are part of APL, like `+`, `×`, `⌈` and `/` (we refer to them as *primitives*), and those functions and operators that are created by the user which are represented, not by a symbol, but by a name like `Average` (we say they are *user-defined*).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also made an important distinction between *functions*, which apply to data and which return data, and *operators*, which apply to functions or data and produce *derived* functions (see [the definition of Reduce](./Some-Primitive-Functions.ipynb#Definition)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can distinguish between 4 major categories of processing tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Name | Examples | Refer to |\n",
    "| :- | :- | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| Built-in tools | Primitive functions | `+` `×` `⌈` `⍴` | Previous chapters |\n",
    "| | Primitive operators | `/` | [Chapter on Operators](./Operators.ipynb) |\n",
    "| User-defined tools | **User-defined functions** | `Average` | This chapter |\n",
    "| | User-defined operators | | [Section on User-Defined Operators](./Operators.ipynb#User-Defined-Operators) |\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is devoted to user-defined *functions*. The subject of user-defined *operators* will be covered later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further categorise user-defined functions according to the way they process data. Firstly we can distinguish between ***Direct*** and ***Procedural*** **functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    " - ***Direct*** functions (commonly referred to as ***dfns***) are defined in a very formal manner.\n",
    "   - They are usually designed for pure calculation, without any external or user interfaces. *Dfns* do not allow loops except by recursion and have limited options for conditional programming.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - ***Procedural*** functions (commonly referred to as ***tradfns***, short for *traditional functions*) are less formal and look much more like programs written in other languages.\n",
    "   - They provide greater flexibility for building major applications which involve user interfaces, access to files or databases and other external interfaces. *Tradfns* may take no arguments and behave like scripts.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Even though you may write entire systems with dfns, you might prefer to restrict their use to encapsulate statements that, together, perform some meaningful operation on the data given.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second distinction we can make concerns the number of arguments a user-defined function can have.\n",
    "\n",
    " - ***Dyadic*** functions take two arguments which are placed on either side of the function (`X f Y`);\n",
    " - ***Monadic*** functions take a single argument which is placed to the right of the function (`f Y`);\n",
    " - ***Niladic*** functions take no argument at all;\n",
    " - ***Ambivalent*** functions are dyadic functions whose left argument is optional."

    "### Configure Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Dyalog APL has a highly configurable development and debugging environment, designed to fit the requirements of very different kinds of programmers. This environment is controlled by configuration parameters; let us determine which context will suit you best.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Do You Need?\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need (except for love) is:\n",
    "\n",
    " - a window in which to type expressions that you want to be executed (white \"Session window\");\n",
    " - one or more windows in which to create/modify user-defined functions (grey \"Edit windows\");\n",
    " - one or more windows to debug execution errors (black \"Trace window\").\n",
    " \n",
    "The colours above refer to the positions of the windows in <!--figure-->the figures below<!--IDE_Window_Layout,IDE_Window_Horizontal_Layout,IDE_Floating_Window_Layout-->.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default configuration is consistent with other software development tools and in it is possible to divide the session window into three parts which can be resized, as shown in <!--figure-->here<!--IDE_Window_Layout-->:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The default window configuration](res/IDE_Window_Layout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration provides a single Edit window and a single Trace window, each of which is \"docked\" along one of the Session window borders. You can dock these windows along any of the Session window sides. For example, <!--figure-->the figure below<!--IDE_Window_Horizontal_Layout--> shows a configuration with three horizontal panes, highly suitable for entering and editing very long statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Edit and Trace windows in a horizontal layout](res/IDE_Window_Horizontal_Layout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Edit window supports the *Multiple Document Interface* (MDI). This means that you can work on more than one function at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    " - On the Windows interpreter you can use the \"Window\" menu to *Tile* and *Cascade*, or you can maximise any one of the functions to concentrate solely upon it.\n",
    " - If you are using RIDE the default behaviour is to open a tab per item you are editing.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you are working on a relatively small screen you may find that you prefer to work with \"floating\" windows in a layout similar to the one in <!--figure-->here<!--IDE_Floating_Window_Layout-->:\n",
    "\n",
    "![\"floating\" windows layout](res/IDE_Floating_Window_Layout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " - On the Windows interpreter, you can either\n",
    "   - grab the border of a sub-window (Edit or Trace) and then drag and drop it in the middle of the session window, as an independent floating window,\n",
    "   - or enable the \"Classic Dyalog mode\", which can be set under \"Options\" ⇨ \"Configure...\" ⇨ \"Trace/Edit\" as shown in <!--figure-->the figure below<!--IDE_Configure_Classic_Mode-->.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Option to set \"Classic Dyalog mode\"](res/IDE_Configure_Classic_Mode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " - If you are using RIDE you can go to \"Edit\" ⇨ \"Preferences\" ⇨ \"Windows\" and enable \"Floating windows\" as shown in <!--figure-->the next figure<!--RIDE_Configure_Floating_Windows-->:\n",
    " \n",
    "![Enable \"floating\" windows in RIDE](res/RIDE_Configure_Floating_Windows.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with floating windows has the added benefit of allowing you to have a stack of trace windows (as opposed to a single trace window), showing which functions calls which other. This will be explored in [the section on configuring the trace tools](./First-Aid-Kit.ipynb#Choose-Your-Configuration)."
