        "When you use APL, you type an expression or a command into the session window, and the result of the expression (or a message resulting from the execution of the command) is displayed on the next line(s). So an APL \"session\" is a sequence of user input lines (expressions and/or commands) interleaved with the results of the expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you type these expressions and/or commands in the Dyalog APL software you installed, or on the [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org), you will see that APL initially positions the input cursor six spaces in from the left margin. Unless you deliberately move the cursor before you start typing, the expressions you enter into the system will therefore be indented; you can evaluate what you type by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, which will make the result appear below what you typed and left aligned with the margin. This interactive session is commonly referred to as an _interpreter session_ because some software is interpreting what you type and providing you with results on the fly.\n",
        "\n",
        "This book, however, was written in Jupyter notebooks, which work in a slightly different way. In here, you can find blocks of text (like the one you are reading *right now*) interleaved with code blocks. Depending on where you are reading this, these code blocks may be static or they may be interactive, allowing you, the reader, to change them and run them at will. The expressions you enter go in the shaded rectangles (the _input cells_, preceded by a `In [X]:`) and you can evaluate them by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. The results of the expressions are then placed inside white rectangles (the _output cells_, preceded by the corresponding `Out[X]:`) which get updated when you re-evaluate the same _input cell_.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is recommended that you go through this tutorial in front of your computer, and experiment by typing the expressions given below into the Dyalog APL interpreter session. Alternatively, if you are reading the book online in a dynamic format, you are encouraged to re-run the _input cells_ for yourself. Either way, try changing the expressions, and observe the new results."
