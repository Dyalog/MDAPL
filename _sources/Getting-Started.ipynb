        "This tutorial is divided into several chapters, each chapter covering a major subject. Each chapter is further divided in sections and subsections that help encapsulate narrower topics for someone who knows exactly what they are looking for.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the end of most chapters you will find a \"*Specialist's Section*\" containing advanced discussions about the symbols or methods presented in the chapter. Because these topics are for more experienced readers, they may use symbols that are not explained until later in the book.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are a beginner, feel free to ignore those sections and skip to the next chapter, or at least don't feel demotivated if you don't understand everything that is covered in those sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "While reading the book, reproduce the given examples on your computer and experiment by yourself using different data; you will learn more from your own experiments than from reading our examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most chapters also include exercises; some are very simple and some are more complex. We recommend that you do try to solve as many exercises as possible. Compare your solutions to the ones we suggest by the end of the chapter. APL is so rich that there may be *several* good solutions to the same problem. Comparing different solutions is always interesting.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the [\"User-Defined Functions\" chapter](./User-Defined-Functions.ipynb) you will be able to write small functions of your own and you may want to print some results, input data using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or read data from files. These topics are presented in self-contained dedicated chapters, so do not hesitate to go back and forth in the book to read about the features you need.\n",
