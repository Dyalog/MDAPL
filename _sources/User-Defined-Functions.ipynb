        "In previous chapters we made a distinction between the functions and operators which are part of APL, like `+`, `\u00d7`, `\u2308` and `/` (we refer to them as *primitives*), and those functions and operators that are created by the user which are represented, not by a symbol, but by a name like `Average` (we say they are *user-defined*).\n",
        "\n",
        "We also made an important distinction between *functions*, which apply to data and which return data, and *operators*, which apply to functions or data and produce *derived* functions (see {numref}`Some-Primitive-Functions-Definition`).\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that we can distinguish between 4 major categories of processing tools:\n",

        "| :- | :- | :-: | :-: |\n",

        "This chapter is devoted to user-defined *functions*. The subject of user-defined *operators* will be covered later.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can further categorise user-defined functions according to the way they process data. Firstly we can distinguish between ***Direct*** and ***Procedural*** **functions**.\n",
        "\n",
        " - ***Direct*** functions (commonly referred to as ***dfns***) are defined in a very formal manner.\n",
        "   - They are usually designed for pure calculation, without any external or user interfaces. *Dfns* do not allow loops except by recursion and have limited options for conditional programming.\n",
        "   \n",
        " - ***Procedural*** functions (commonly referred to as ***tradfns***, short for *traditional functions*) are less formal and look much more like programs written in other languages.\n",
        "   - They provide greater flexibility for building major applications which involve user interfaces, access to files or databases and other external interfaces. *Tradfns* may take no arguments and behave like scripts.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Even though you may write entire systems with dfns, you might prefer to restrict their use to encapsulate statements that, together, perform some meaningful operation on the data given.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second distinction we can make concerns the number of arguments a user-defined function can have.\n",
        "\n",
        " - ***Dyadic*** functions take two arguments which are placed on either side of the function (`X f Y`);\n",
        " - ***Monadic*** functions take a single argument which is placed to the right of the function (`f Y`);\n",
        " - ***Niladic*** functions take no argument at all;\n",
        " - ***Ambivalent*** functions are dyadic functions whose left argument is optional."
