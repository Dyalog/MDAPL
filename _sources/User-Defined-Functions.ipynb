        " - the arguments `\u2375` and `\u237a` retain the values passed to them as arguments and may not be changed. Any attempt to modify them causes a `SYNTAX ERROR` to be reported, except when *defaulting the left argument* (cf. {numref}`User-Defined-Functions-Default-Left-Argument`);\n",
        " - as soon as an expression generates a result that is not assigned to a name or used in any other way, the function terminates, and the value of that expression is returned as the result of the function. If the function contains more lines they will not be executed (cf. {numref}`User-Defined-Functions-Returning-a-Result`);\n",

For this to happen, we first need to find out how many numbers we need. If a vector has `\u2262\u2375` elements and we are going to drop `\u237a` of them, we are going to be left with `(\u2262\u2375)-\u237a`.

But that number must be at least `0` elements (i.e. \"keep no elements\") because it makes no sense to keep a negative number of elements. So we can just use `\u2308` to find the maximum between `0` and `(\u2262\u2375)-\u237a`. If `\u237a` is too large, `0\u2308(\u2262\u2375)-\u237a` gives `0` and `\u23730` is the empty vector `\u236c`, so the indexing will work just fine."
