        "\n",
        " - ***direct*** functions (commonly referred to as ***dfns***) are defined in a very formal manner; they are usually designed for pure calculation, without any external or user interfaces. *Dfns* do not allow loops except by recursion and have limited options for conditional programming; and\n",
        "   \n",
        " - ***procedural*** functions (commonly referred to as ***tradfns***, short for *traditional functions*) are less formal and look much more like programs written in other languages; they provide greater flexibility for building major applications which involve user interfaces, access to files or databases and other external interfaces. *Tradfns* may take no arguments and behave like scripts.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Even though you may write entire systems with dfns, you might prefer to restrict their use to encapsulate statements that, together, perform some meaningful operation on the data given. We will start by covering the syntax and characteristics of dfns, then we will do the same for tradfns, and then {numref}`User-Defined-Functions-Dfns-Versus-Tradfns` will compare the main characteristics of both of them, to help you understand when and why each should be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second distinction we can make concerns the number of arguments a user-defined function can have.\n",
        "\n",
        " - ***dyadic*** functions take two arguments which are placed on either side of the function (`X f Y`);\n",
        " - ***monadic*** functions take a single argument which is placed to the right of the function (`f Y`);\n",
        " - ***niladic*** functions take no argument at all; and\n",
        " - ***ambivalent*** functions are dyadic functions whose left argument is optional."

        " - the arguments `\u2375` and `\u237a` retain the values passed to them as arguments and may not be changed. Any attempt to modify them causes a `SYNTAX ERROR` to be reported, except when *defaulting the left argument* (cf. {numref}`User-Defined-Functions-Default-Left-Argument`);\n",
        " - as soon as an expression generates a result that is not assigned to a name or used in any other way, the function terminates, and the value of that expression is returned as the result of the function. If the function contains more lines they will not be executed (cf. {numref}`User-Defined-Functions-Returning-the-Result`); and\n",

The APL language offers a special set of syntactic elements to control the flow of statements inside tradfns.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the very first versions of APL, the only way to implement conditional execution and looping was to use the symbol `\u2192` (the *branch arrow*, typed with <kbd>APL</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd>). This was used to jump from one statement to another, skipping over other statements (conditional execution) or jumping back to repeat a set of statements again (looping). The branch arrow is equivalent to the GOTO statement in other languages. Contemporary versions of APL include a special set of keywords which offer a much more flexible, easy to use and easy to read way to control the flow of execution. They are also very similar to those used in most other languages. These are known as ***Control structures***.\n",

        "Control structures are blocks of statements which begin and end with special keywords. These keywords are all **prefixed** with a ***colon***, like `:If` or `:Repeat`. This prevents the names of your variables to clash with these keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "The keywords can be typed in lower or upper case, but Dyalog APL will always store and display them using a fixed spelling convention commonly known as CamelCase or, more specifically, PascalCase. Following this convention, a keyword has an upper case first letter and the following letters in lower case. Composite keywords like \"`EndIf`\" and \"`GoTo`\" capitalise the first letter of each word.\n",

        "On top of that, if you have a complex function that is not working as it should, you may find it easier to debug if it contains control structures rather than if the flow control of the program were controlled by recursion or operators: with control structures you get more fine-grained control over where in the code you want to start debugging and how to do it.\n",

              "\u2502So I say to you, my friends, that even though we must face the\u2502difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is\u2502a dream deeply rooted in the American dream that one day this\u2502nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:\u2502we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\u2502created equal.\u2502I have a dream that one day, on the red hills of Georgia, sons\u2502of former slaves, and sons of former slave-owners will be able\u2502to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. \u2502I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a\u2502state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the\u2502heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom\u2502and justice.\u2502I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a\u2502nation where they will not be juged by the color of their skin\u2502but by content of their character.\u2502I have a dream today!\u2502I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious\u2502racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the\u2502words of interposition and nullification, that one day, right \u2502there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able\u2502to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters\u2502and brothers. I have a dream today!\u2502I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every\u2502hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places shall be\u2502made plain, and the crooked places shall be made straight and the\u2502glory of the Lord will be revealed and all flesh shall seet it\u2502together.\u2502This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South\u2502with.\u2502With this faith, we will be able to hear out of the mountain of\u2502despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to\u2502transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful\u2502symphony of brotherhood.\u2502With this faith, we will be able to work together, knowing that\u2502we will be free one day. This will be the day when all of God's\u2502children will be able to sing with new meaning - \"My country \u2502'this of thee; sweet land of liberty; of thee I sing; land where\u2502my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride; from every mountain\u2502side, let freedom ring\" - and if America is to be a great nation,\u2502this must become true.\u2502So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.\u2502Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.\u2502Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.\u2502Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.\u2502Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.\u2502But not only that.\u2502Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.\u2502Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennesse.\u2502Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi, from\u2502every mountainside, let freedom ring.\u2502And when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every\u2502village and hamlet, from every state and city, we will be able\u2502to speed up that day when all of God's children - black men and\u2502white men, Jews and Gentiles, Catholics and Protestants - will be\u2502able to join hands and to sing the words of the old Negro Spiritual;\u2502\"Free at last, free at last; thank God Almighty, we are free at last\".  \u2502-- Martin Luther King Jr. -- \u2502Washington,August 28th 1963.\u2502\u2502\n",

Otherwise, you can print to a PDF file. Please notice that the contents of the workspace that get printed are all of the named objects you have: variables, functions, operators, etc. If you just type `3 + 3` in the interpreter and execute it, that does not get printed with this method \u2013 to print the log you need to go to \"Log\" &#8680; \"Print...\".\n",

        "We can use a reasoning similar to that of the first exercise, except now we want to start the indices at `\u237a+1` and go up until `\u2262\u2375`. For this to happen, we first need to find out how many numbers we need. If a vector has `\u2262\u2375` elements and we are going to drop `\u237a` of them, we are going to be left with `(\u2262\u2375)-\u237a`. This means `\u2373(\u2262\u2375)-\u237a` will generate the correct amount of indices, but they will be starting at `1` and should start at `\u237a+1`, so we just need to add `\u237a` to that.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we just need to worry about what happens if `\u237a` is too large, i.e. if we want to ignore too many elements. The reverse of that concern is, what happens if `(\u2262\u2375)-\u237a` is too small? Recall that `(\u2262\u2375)-\u237a` tells you how many elements you will want to keep. But that number must be at least `0` elements (i.e. \"keep no elements\") because it makes no sense to keep a negative number of elements. So we can just use `\u2308` to find the maximum between `0` and `(\u2262\u2375)-\u237a`. If `\u237a` is too large, `0\u2308(\u2262\u2375)-\u237a` gives `0` and `\u23730` is the empty vector `\u236c`, so the indexing will work just fine."
