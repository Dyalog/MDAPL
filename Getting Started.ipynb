    " 1. Dyalog APL: allows your computer to understand APL code and evaluate it;\n",
    " 2. an IDE (Integrated Development Environment): provides a nice interface for you to communicate with Dyalog APL, the component mentioned above.\n",

For example, the <kbd>A</kbd> key types an `a` when you press it, and if you press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> you type an `A`. With APL we introduce another \"shifting\" key so that the same key can be used to produce even more symbols.

It also means you can hit <kbd>&grave;</kbd> <kbd>&grave;</kbd> and then type to input a glyph by its name.

To make sure, you can either try the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> combinations to see which one types a `⍴`, or you can hover the glyph `⍴` in the language bar and look at the top of the tooltip that appears, which also gives you instructions on how to type the given glyph.

When the workspace is saved, everything the user defined is saved together in a single file, in the same way as for example, a spreadsheet saves its values and its formatting.\n",

Alternatively, you can also download it directly from [this](https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/files/MasteringDyalogAPL_CompanionFiles.zip) link. You can change its name, but we also recommend that you keep the default extension `.dws`.\n",

    "### The APL Session Log\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only you can use the workspace concept to save everything you defined from one programming session to the other, RIDE and the Windows IDE also save your ***Session Log***. The *session log* is composed of every single line you enter (your inputs) and the results the program gives you (the outputs). You can scroll back in that log and re-execute a line by putting your text cursor in that line and pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you can execute several lines from the session log in one go. To mark a line for execution, you just have to change it in some may. You can make a real alteration, or a cosmetic change that has no material effect on the expression to be executed, like pressing <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> at the end of the line. As soon as you make any sort of modification to the line, the colour of the text will change. You can undo a change and restore a line to its original state by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the marked lines press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. They will be executed from top to bottom, not in the order you selected them. Note however that if an expression generates an error, the remaining lines will not be executed. It is also worthwhile mentioning that if you go back to an expression to modify it, when you rerun it with <kbd>Enter</kbd> the entire expression will be copied to the bottom of the log instead of being modified in place. This allows you to always know what you typed in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The session log is not limited just to the current session, and you can scroll back to retrieve expressions and results from previous sessions, limited only by the size of the log. This is specified in \"Options > Configure... > Session > Logs and Buffers\" for the Windows IDE and \"Edit > Preferences > General > Session\" for RIDE.\n",

If you know the name of a glyph, you can enter <kbd>&grave;</kbd><kbd>&grave;</kbd> and start typing the name of the glyph, that RIDE's auto complete feature will try to suggest the appropriate glyph. For example, if you press <kbd>&grave;</kbd> <kbd>&grave;</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>L</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd> (because you want to input the Greek letter *ALP*ha) then RIDE would show you a suggestion list similar to the one shown in the figure below.\n",

Comparing different solutions is always interesting.\n",
